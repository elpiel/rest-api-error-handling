Example of error handling in a REST API
=======================================

When dealing with structure that has multiple levels like in [DDD (Domain-Driven Design)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
where you would like to separate the Domain, Infrastructure and Application layers, we need to find a good way to
represent and handle the errors at hand.

This is where this repository comes into play. This is an example of how error handling can be done, even if there are
multiple layers for one of the projects where we are building a REST API.
